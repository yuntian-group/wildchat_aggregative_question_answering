## Front End Demo For Paper *From Chat Logs to Collective Insights: Aggregative Question Answering*

This demo is based on Next.js and React.js. To run the demo, you need to first install node.js . Make sure your instruction `node -v` and `npm -v` returns proper response. 

Then you can run 
```
npm install .
```

To install necessary packages.

And then run

```
npx next dev
```

to start the demo.

## TODO

The Repo is still not compilable due to some TypeScript implementation. We may fix this in the future.
